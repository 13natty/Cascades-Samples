Push Collector

========================================================================
The 10.2 folder contains our headless sample application that runs on 
BlackBerry 10.2. Our application shows you how to use a headless application 
to receive and process a push message. From 10.2 and onward, using a headless
application is the recommended approach for handling push messages. 

The 10.0 folder contains our sample application that runs on BlackBerry 10.1
and earlier. Our application in the 10.0 folder also shows you how to receive 
and process a push message, but it's not a headless application.
