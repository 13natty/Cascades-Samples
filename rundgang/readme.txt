Rundgång - Email application

========================================================================
Sample Description. 

Rundgång means feedback in addresses, well to be completely honest its
the kind of feedback that appears when the soundguy is not doing his 
job. But feedback is the main topic of this app, it shows how to set up
an email with a list of adresses and attach different kinds of files 
to it. In addition it also illustrates application structure for a QML
based app.

 - Collect data from, an AudioRecoder and Camera (photo and QR code).
 - Create an application menu that can be accessed anywhere.
 - Use data sources to populate  GroupDataModels.
