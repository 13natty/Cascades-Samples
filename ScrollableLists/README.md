# Horizontally Scrolling UIs

This collection of samples shows how you can create a UI that scrolls horizontally in Cascades.

They are all built on the same basic controls with minor differences in how they handle the data loading.

1_bulk - loads the all of the data up front

2_paged - uses a "get more" button to load more data manually when the user gets to the end
