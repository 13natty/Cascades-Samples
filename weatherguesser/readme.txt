Weather Guesser - Navigation

========================================================================
Sample Description.

Weather guessing has been a human activity that has gone on for
thousands of years. Nowadays there are even television programs
devoted to this phenomenon. The main objective of this app, apart
from producing more or less accurate weather forecasts, is to
show how to go about setting up an application using tabbed and
navigation panes. It also shows how to load data using both SQL
and non-local JSON feeds.

You will learn how to:
 - Use the NavigationPane and TabbedPane.
 - Use the AsyncDataModel and SqlDataQuery.
 - Use the AsyncHeaderDataModel and SqlHeaderDataQuery.
 - Load data at the top and bottom of a list.
 - Handle custom list items.
