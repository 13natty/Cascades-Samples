SensorDemo

========================================================================
Sample Description.

The networking sample app shows you how to create a sample app that 
sends an HTTP request, retrieves an XML file containing a contact 
list, and displays the list of contacts in a ListView control.

This networking sample also shows you how to check for network 
connectivity and how to determine what interface the device is using 
to make the network connection (Wifi, cellular, and so on).

You will learn how to:

Create a list and a SystemProgressToast
Send an HTTP request over the network
Save the network reply data to the device file system
Communicate between C++ and QML
Check for connectivity and display this in the UI
Determine which connection interface (Wifi, cellular, etc.) the device
is using to make the connection
