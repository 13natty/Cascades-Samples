CustomBarcodeScanner

This is a custom barcode scanner that demonstrates how to process the preview frames from the camera. If you just want to scan barcodes, you probably want to take a look at the BarcodeReader sample, which walks you through using the built-in BarcodeDetector component.

This app demonstrates how to:
1) Create a custom component (BarcodeDecoder)
2) Process preview frames from the camera
3) Use the ZXing library
4) Act as a Card
5) Use the Camera.

The BarcodeInvoker app demonstrates how to invoke this app as a card.
